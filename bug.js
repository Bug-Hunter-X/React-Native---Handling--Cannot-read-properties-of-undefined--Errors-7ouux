This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's especially common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when components render before data has fully loaded.

```javascript
// Example
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUserData().then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{user.name}</Text> // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
    </View>
  );
};
```
